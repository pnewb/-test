# We've got to start somewhere, so why not here?
The E3D v6 was the baseline of "this is a pretty good hotend" when I got into printing.  It's served me well even though I've largely moved on, but it still seems like a great place to start.  What we have is a [Siboor v6 heatsink](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804661463785.html) with the Dragon pattern mounting holes.  Easy to secure, doesn't use the (deservedly) dreaded groove mount, uses a bunch of parts I have on hand.  Including the cheapest 40w heater from my give away box, and the lightest probably-aluminum-but-maybe-something-cheaper? heat block and a [ti heatbreak from Triangle Lab](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832667233248.html) and also a [104-GT](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832661137972.html) thermistor from them.  Perfectly servicable, and nothing special.

# The Cheapest of the Cheap - brass 0.4
That gets us our very first actual graphs and numbers:
The cheapest no-name 0.4 brass (probably?) nozzle that was again, sitting around in a random drawer.

Looks about like what we'd expect, which is nice.  230 isn't _really_ hot enough for extruding ABS, and things start falling off pretty hard past 14mm^3/s, regardless of the higher temperatures.

# Baby's First Tungsten Carbide
The other 0.4 I had on hand was a tungsten carbide nozzle from a discord user who was selling them off back before real full TC nozzles were seemingly on every street corner.  This one holds out a _little_ better, but realistically the same flow rate limits are still applicable. Upwards of 14mm^3/s you're pretty much out of luck.  Not surprising since there isn't any custom internal geometry.
