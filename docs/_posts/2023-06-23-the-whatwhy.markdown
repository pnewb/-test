# So what's this all about?
In short: I got tired of not having a canonical set of data available on flow rates for nozzles and hotends.  Manufacturers give cherry picked numbers, and though I feel that CNC Kitchen did a great job (see later where I use basically his whole setup...) he (along with most folks out there) have got sponsors to worry about, and content to create that's engaging to viewers...and like...people have attention spans that won't really lend themselves to a 4 hour long video.

# How many things will you test?
I'm sitting on about 10 different hotends, and something like 25 nozzles at the moment.  All paid for out of my own pocket with the exception of a single bozzle, which is on loan, since those things just can't be purchased at the moment.  The plan is to continue this way.  If enough folks want something tested (except get out of here with those Diamondback nozzles, I've no interest in paying $100 for a single test piece here) I'll likely test it.  If a single individual wants something tested, and feels confident enough to send it to a stranger on the internet, along with a prepaid return sticker, I'll probably test that thing, too.  But I don't think I'll be accepting anything from vendors or manufacturers.  This _may_ change in the future, and if it does, that will come along with some very very obvious disclosure statements.

# Why should we trust you?
Probably you shouldn't.  Or anyone else.  This is the internet after all, and people are shady.  But I'm doing my best to be transparent about this, and including some data that's here just for the sake of setting baselines which anyone else can test against to see if I'm even roughly in the ballpark.  At the end of the day though, I don't really care if Hotend X with Nozzle Y and a Z Watt heater cartridge tops out at 34.5 mm^3/s.  What I care about is that specific combinations are X% more or less than specific other combinations.  If someone has a v6 and a 0.4 brass nozzle, but they're outrunning it...basically anything is better, sure.  But if someone has a Bambu Lab, and they want to print faster...what are the _real_ options available?  Will a Revo be faster? What about with an HF nozzle?  Or even a v6 with a CHT?  At this point, I can't make any suggestions with real certainty, just gut feelings.

# Your data is flawed, your tooling is bad, and you're a terrible human being for not including my favorite stuff
My data probably _is_ flawed.  But hopefully it's consistently flawed, which would be just fine.  As to the tooling? Well, it's here to get the job done, not to win me any awards or get me hired somewhere.  I'm aiming for straightforward simplicity, not 'elegance'.  And as to the last point, I'm working out of my own pockets here.  So there will be limitations, and it's going to be slow because I do have a day job to contend with, and other hobbies, and this is already proving to be a slog and I'm probably less than %5 in.
